# Welcome
This repository hosts the interactive web map associated with the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers Leachate Collaborative project ['The Threat of Landfill Leachate to the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers.'](https://www.leachateloophole.org)

The goal of the project is to describe the regulatory gaps that allow the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers to be polluted by landfill leachate, and to help the communities that use the rivers for drinking water in solving this problem.
